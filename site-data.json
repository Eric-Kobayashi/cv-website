  "summary": "<b>Hello!</b> I am a Croucher Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Exeter. My research centers on how volcanic eruptions affect the Earth's climate. During my PhD, I used state-of-the-art Earth System Model to study how volcanic aerosols affect surface climate responses and stratospheric ozone. In my current research, I investigate climate-volcano feedbacks — how a warmer climate affects volcanic plumes and the subsequent effects on climate, and the impacts of volcanic eruptions on climate extremes and crop system. ",
  "about": "I am a Croucher Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter working at the interface of volcanology, climate dynamics, and atmospheric chemistry. During my PhD in Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, I developed <a href=\"https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-2749.html\">UKESM‑VPLUME</a> — a framework coupling a one‑dimensional volcanic plume model with the UK Earth System Model — and conducted more than 5000 model‑years of simulations. My work shows that (i) climate projection studies very likely underestimate future volcanic forcing and its climate effects, (ii) future volcanic forcing can contribute up to ~49% of climate uncertainty, and (iii) future eruptions may delay Antarctic ozone hole recovery. Previously, during my MPhil at CUHK, I studied the role of water in heterogeneous oxidation of atmospheric organic aerosols.",
